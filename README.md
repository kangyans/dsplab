# DSPLAB

This repo, which is inspired by [dMRI_sequence_simulations](https://github.com/TardifLab/dMRI_sequence_simulations) is aimed at the simulation of the spiral-based diffusion-weighted imaging pulse sequence and resulting point spread function. The difference from ```dMRI sequence simulation``` is that we used **NUFFT** instead of gridding and **EPG** to simulate the signal evolution.

## Requirement
* Spiral trajectory design: [http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/vdspiral/](http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/vdspiral/)
* NUFFT toolbox: [https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/)
* Extended Phase Graphs(EPG): [https://github.com/kangyans/MRSignalsSeqs](https://github.com/kangyans/MRSignalsSeqs)
