# DSPLAB

This repo is derived from [dMRI_sequence_simulations](https://github.com/TardifLab/dMRI_sequence_simulations) and is designed to simulate of the spiral-based diffusion-weighted imaging pulse sequence and resulting point spread function. Unlike ```dMRI sequence simulation```, we used **NUFFT** instead of gridding for spiral imaging reconstruction and **EPG** to simulate the evolution of the MR signal.

## Requirement
* Spiral trajectory design: [http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/vdspiral/](http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/vdspiral/)
* NUFFT toolbox: [https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/)
* Extended Phase Graphs(EPG): [https://github.com/kangyans/MRSignalsSeqs](https://github.com/kangyans/MRSignalsSeqs)
