# dsplab

this repo is aimed at the simulation of spiral-based diffusion-weighted imaging. This is inspired by [dMRI_sequence_simulations](https://github.com/TardifLab/dMRI_sequence_simulations). The difference is that we used **NUFFT** instead of gridding and **EPG** to simulate the signal evolution.
