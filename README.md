# DSPLAB

This repo is derived from [dMRI_sequence_simulations](https://github.com/TardifLab/dMRI_sequence_simulations) and is designed to simulate of the spiral-based diffusion-weighted imaging pulse sequence and resulting point spread function. Unlike ```dMRI sequence simulation```, we used **NUFFT** instead of gridding for spiral imaging reconstruction and **EPG** to simulate the evolution of the MR signal.

## Prerequisite
* [Spiral Trajectory Design](http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/vdspiral/)
* [NUFFT Toolbox](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/)
* [Extended Phase Graphs(EPG)](https://github.com/kangyans/MRSignalsSeqs)
